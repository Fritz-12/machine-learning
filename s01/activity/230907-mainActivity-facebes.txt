Hi, My name is Fritz William C. Acebes.

I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at De La Salle University-Dasmari√±as. I have recently finished my 
internship at CAWIL.AI, a company that focuses on Computer Vision Artificial Intelligence. With the experience and knowledge that 
I got from my internship, I am able to use it on my studies especially with our research which also uses on Computer Vision.
