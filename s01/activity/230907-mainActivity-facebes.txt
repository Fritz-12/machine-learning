Hi, My name is Fritz William C. Acebes.

I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at De La Salle University-Dasmari√±as. I have recently finished my 
internship at CAWIL.AI, a company that focuses on Computer Vision Artificial Intelligence. With the experience and knowledge that 
I got from my internship, I am able to use it on my studies especially with our research which also uses on Computer Vision.

I love to watch films and my first movie which really helped developed my love for film would be, Call Me By Your Name. I love movies
that would make me feel and think. I would stay up late just to watch movies, watch in-depth breakdown of movies, read reddit to get
information and other's perspective on the movie. I am also an avid fan of A24 movies, my favorite movies from their company are 
Everything Everywhere All at Once, Lady Bird, Herditary, The Farewell, Midsommar, and many more but if I have to pick one movie, 
it would be Everything Everywhere All at Once. A A24 movie just droppped at the cinemas called Past Lives, and I am going to watch
it this Friday.
